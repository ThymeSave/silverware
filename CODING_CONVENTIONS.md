Coding Conventions
===

## Angular TypeScript

Most coding conventions are already covered by eslint.

Things that can not be covered, are documented below:

### Imports

- Order of imports
  - non UMD bundles (`import * as foo`)
  - Angular Libraries
  - Third Party libraries
  - `@thymesave/*`
  - Local imports
